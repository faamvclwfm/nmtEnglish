      <p style="font-weight: bold;">Fascinating people's stories </p>
      <p>In June 2018, after football practice, 12 boys and their 25-year-old coach decided to explore Tham Luang cave in Thailand. They walked into the cave, but a flash flood forced them deeper, and they ended up on a platform four kilometers in.
        The cave filled with water, trapping them for 17 days. With no food for the first nine days, they drank water from dripping stalactites and took turns digging a hole, hoping to escape.
        Finally, some divers found them. It was a long and dangerous journey to bring them out of the cave. The boys had to wear special masks to breathe underwater and hold hands with two divers while they swam through dark, narrow tunnels. Sadly, one rescuer, a former Thai Navy Seal died during that operation.</p>

      <p>Cindy Busick from Sanford, NC, had a incredible escape from a tornado. The tornado struck her home, tearing it apart and sending her 75 yards away while she was in her bathtub.
        "I flew a football field length in a bath tub," remembered Cindy, the survivor. The woman had crawled under the bathtub to stay safe. After the tornado, she found that her belongings were scattered up to 70 miles away. With only a few clothes left, Cindy got emergency help from the Red Cross. Her husband, Kevin, who came back from Africa after the tornado, found his wedding band in the ruins.
        Cindy and Kevin are grateful for the help they had received and plan to give back when they can.</p>

      <p>The Sierra Nevada mountains are a popular destination for tourists and hikers. On August 6, 2014, Mike Vilhauer set out for a day of fly fishing in this picturesque region. After several hours of unsuccessful fishing, he decided to use grasshoppers instead of flies and went to find some. Enjoying the walk, Mike lost track of time and realized it was getting dark. Unable to return to his spot, he spent the night under a pine tree.
        His phone signal was blocked by the mountains.
        Some days he followed a small stream but got even more lost. Then he heard a rescue helicopter but it didn't spot him. Returning to his temporary camp, he finally saw a rescue dog and a search team. They had been looking for him since Friday. Mike was exhausted but otherwise fine.</p>

      <p>British dairy farmer Dougal Robertson wanted to give his family an adventure, so on January 27, 1971, he, his wife, and their four children set sail on a wooden boat named Lucette. Despite Dougal's background in the British _merchant
        navy, he hadn't prepared much for the trip. The family enjoyed their time sailing until June 15, 1972, when killer whales attacked their boat near the Galapagos Islands, damaging it badly and causing it to sink. With only a lifeboat, a small dinghy, and six days' worth of food, they survived on rainwater and hunted turtles. After 16 days, their lifeboat became unusable, and they moved to the overcrowded dinghy. They were rescued by Japanese fishermen on July 23, 1972. The Robertson family had been lost at sea for 38 days.</p>

      <p>Aron Ralston's survival story is an example of extraordinary courage. In 2003, while he was hiking alone in Utah's Bluejohn Canyon, a big stone fell and trapped his right arm. With no hope of rescue and limited resources, Ralston faced an impossible decision. After five days of unimaginable suffering, he made the drastic choice to amputate his own arm to free himself.
        Afterwards, he walked seven miles to his truck and a tourist family found him. Despite the physical and mental trauma, Ralston survived.Nowadays, he continues to climb mountains and is an inspiration to many through hisunbelievable story.</p>

      <p>Spending 13 months adrift at sea made José Salvador Alvarenga, a Salvadoran fisherman, the first person known to survive over a year on a small boat at sea. In November, 2012, Alvarenga and a young fisherman Ezequiel Cordoba set out from a fishing village in southern Mexico. They aimed for a short trip to catch sharks and tunas. A severe storm hit shortly after, damaging their boat and radio. The rescue team had no success. The fishermen were believed to die during the storm.Without supplies, the men survived by eating raw fish, turtles, and jellyfish, and drinking rainwater and turtle blood. Cordoba fell ill and died after months at sea. Alvarenga was alone for nine more months before spotting an island and swimming to shore. He was found by a local couple in the Marshall Islands, having been in the sea for over 438 days.</p>
